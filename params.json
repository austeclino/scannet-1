{"name":"Scannet","tagline":"A software tool for identifying communities in Networks of Proteins","body":"##**Project Scannet**\r\n\r\nThe Protein Similarity Networks (PSN) method is a powerful tool for identifying communities in complex networks of proteins. Its original implementation consisted of different algorithms coded in different programming languages, making it difficult to use. This paper presents the SCANNET tool, which integrates all algorithms of the PSN into a unique tool to perform all PSN's steps as a single workflow.\r\n\r\nThe SCANNET software was subjected to validation using case studies with data from enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of chitin: the Chitin synthase (EC 2.1.4.16), the UDP-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (EC 2.7.7.23) and the Acetylglucosamine Phosphate Deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.25 ). By using SCANNET, the user could implement a single workflow and was capable of identifying correctly the communities in proteins of complex networks containing such enzymes. SCANNET has correctly generated the Complex Networks, the Dendograms and the Color Matrix for each of the case studies.\r\n\r\nThe experiments with SCANNET have shown that it is a simple, efficient, reliable and intuitive implementation of the PSN method to identify communities in complex networks of proteins. In addition, SCANNET improves the graphical interface used in the PSN, generating critical networks, dendrograms and color matrixes that can be viewed in the software itself, offering a friendly interface for the users. The next step of our study will be the application of SCANNET in other research areas, in which the identification of communities in complex networks can help the understanding of complex systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
